# Inventory Management System
A simple Inventory Management System using the Flask framework, to test out the framework.
The app allows the user to update the inventory of products stored in different warehouses, adding delivery logs for each change. 
Incoming deliveries can be marked as incoming so as to not require the user to set a date beforehand.
Currently lacking full CRUD functionality.
